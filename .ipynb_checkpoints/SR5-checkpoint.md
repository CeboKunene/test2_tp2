#Time and Space Complexity Analysis

Insertion Sort Algorithm

* Time Complexity:
	+ Best Case: O(n)
	+ Average Case: O(n^2)
	+ Worst Case: O(n^2)
* Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting)

Efficiency Explanation:

* The insertion sort algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the average and worst cases, making it less efficient for large datasets.
* However, in the best case (when the input is already sorted), the algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), making it efficient for nearly sorted data.
* The algorithm uses a simple iterative approach, requiring only a single additional memory space for temporary swapping, making it a space-efficient algorithm with O(1) spaceÂ complexity.
