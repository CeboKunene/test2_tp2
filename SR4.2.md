#Linear and binary

*Binary Search  is  Fast for large datasets .

*Binary search works by dividing the search space in half at each step, reducing the number of comparisons needed to find the target element.

*This division process results in a logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)), making binary search much faster for large datasets.
